# Field Training Next - Documentation

A **police training management system** that helps track and document the progress of *trainee officers* through their field training program. The system allows **trainers (FTOs)** to create various types of training reports like *Daily Observation Reports*, *End of Week Reports*, and *Officer Safety Reports* to document trainee performance. It includes **secure authentication** with automatic logout for idle users, role-based permissions, and the ability to search, view, and export reports as PDFs for official documentation.
